## I write ideas, develop silly apps, and overall try and make the net a fun place

Recently I was reading an article about how the net isn't fun anymore. Well... let's try and change that. Initially this was going to be the home to one of my apps (ijustcant), but I've decided to try and create and link to fun internet things. 

The markdown below is Jekyll on Github. I've left it for now because I use it as a reference. Ultimately I'll move it so you it doesn't bother you!

### Markdown

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/gregortheoverlander/gregortheoverlander.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
